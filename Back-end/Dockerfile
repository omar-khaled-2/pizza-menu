# This Dockerfile is used to build a Node.js application image.
# It consists of multiple stages to optimize the build process and reduce image size.

ARG NODE_VERSION=19.6

# Stage 1: Base Image
# - Sets the working directory to /usr/src/app
# - Copies package.json and package-lock.json (if exists) to the working directory
FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}-alpine AS base
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json .

# Stage 2: Dependencies
# - Uses the baseImage as the starting point
# - Installs project dependencies using npm
# - Utilizes Docker build cache for faster builds
FROM base AS dependencies
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/usr/src/app/.npm \
    npm set cache /usr/src/app/.npm && \
    npm install

# Stage 3: Development
# - Uses the dependencies stage as the starting point
# - Copies the entire project to the working directory
# - Sets the default command to run the development server
FROM dependencies AS development
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]

# Stage 4: Production
# - Uses the development stage as the starting point
# - Sets the NODE_ENV environment variable to production
# - Installs only production dependencies using npm ci
# - Changes ownership of the /usr/src/app/src and /usr/src/app/healthcheck directories to node:node
